Issues - 
** Tabs show twice
   SOLUTION - restart server and refresh page

** Remove extensions (eg. projects)
   SOLUTION - rails destroy refinery:engine engine_name

** How do I load my javascript and custom css files?
   SOLUTION - C:\Users\Laura\Documents\railsVM\TheisRailsApp\config\initializers\assets.rb, add the following under precompile assets. These files (projects.css & royalslider.css) are found under C:\Users\Laura\Documents\railsVM\scape-cms\app\assets\stylesheets.
      Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( projects.css )
      Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( royalslider.css )

** Where is the home page content found?
   SOLUTION - C:\Users\Laura\Documents\railsVM\scape-cms\app\views\refinery\pages

** acts_as_indexed - I removed this from the Gemfile as it was not allowing me to save pages in my localhost to the vagrant/tmp folder. I am not sure what other issues this will cause.

** Do I need extensions for projects / works so that the form is created correctly for editing in Refinery? Why can I not create the form like the products set up in my CareerFoundry project?
   SOLUTION - from http://www.refinerycms.com/guides/generate-an-extension-to-use-your-mvcs, "Although we could technically create a new page in Refinery to add the event content there, areas that have special functionality are much better suited as an extension."

$ rails generate refinery:engine project name:string location:string year:string description:text img_1:image img_2:image img_3:image img_4:image img_5:image img_6:image img_7:image img_8:image img_home:image
$ bundle install
$ rails generate refinery:projects
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
(restart server)

** What is the rails image path - for the local host? For Heroku?
   SOLUTION - ?

** I do not think the the extension "Image Slideshows" is necessary unless I cannot get royalslider.js working.
